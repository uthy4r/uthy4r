# My-profile
# Hi, I'm Uthman Babatunde, M.D. 👋

**Medical Doctor • Applied AI/ML Researcher • AI Safety & Healthcare**

I build **safety-aligned AI systems for clinical deployment**, specializing in multimodal screening agents (voice/text), fine-tuned LLMs, and RAG architectures for mental health and substance use disorder interventions in resource-constrained settings.

## 🔬 Research Focus

**Frontier AI Safety & Clinical Deployment**  
Engineering robust, interpretable AI systems at the intersection of large language models and healthcare. My work focuses on:
- **Hallucination mitigation** & bias reduction in clinical LLMs
- **Multimodal screening agents** (voice + text) for mental health assessment
- **RAG architectures** for evidence-grounded clinical decision support
- **Safety alignment** for real-world healthcare delivery in low-resource contexts

## 📚 Featured Projects

### 🏥 [Hospital Readmission Risk Prediction](https://github.com/uthy4r/hospital-readmission-prediction)
End-to-end ML pipeline predicting 30-day hospital readmission using Random Forest + SMOTE. Built with scikit-learn and deployed as a Streamlit web app.
- **Tech**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, Streamlit
- **Impact**: 89% precision for high-risk flagging with class imbalance handling

### 💬 Braveheart Youth SUD RAG Chatbot
Safety-aligned RAG chatbot for youth with substance use disorders, incorporating culturally relevant language and escalation protocols.
- **Hallucination Reduction**: ~40% reduction in irrelevant responses
- **Safety**: Multi-stage validation with human clinician escalation pathways

### 🔍 Clinical RAG Pipeline for Decision Support
Real-time clinical RAG system (LangChain + Pinecone) for evidence-grounded medical decision support.
- **Latency**: <200 ms query response
- **Reliability**: ~40% reduction in GPT-4 hallucinations
